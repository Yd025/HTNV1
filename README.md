# Operation: Overwatch — teammate start

Hack the North WHITEOUT base. This repo already contains the shared intelligence loop, simulator adapter, and HUD.

**Four-person team: start with [docs/team/README.md](docs/team/README.md).** The shared setup is on `dev`; each person works on their assigned branch and opens small PRs into `dev`. Tracking research and the proposed predictive handoff are in [docs/research/TRACKING_RESEARCH.md](docs/research/TRACKING_RESEARCH.md).

**Agents (Cursor/Codex/etc.): read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first** — architecture, file map, invariants, arctic-sim adapter. Humans: this README is the 10-minute bring-up.

```
Adapter (local SITL / kinematic, or Saturday WHITEOUT)
    → World model + coverage grid + target tracker
    → C2 roles + per-class platform agents (10 Hz)      ← flies the fleet
    → Slow DAG advisor (15 s, optional LLM)             ← does not send gotos
    → TimescaleDB + WebSocket scoreboard HUD
```

## Bring-up (anyone, first 10 minutes)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # already has FORCE_KINEMATIC=1
docker compose up --build
```

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Scoreboard HUD | http://localhost:3000 |
| Health / deploy flag | http://localhost:8000/health |
| Headless agent | Separate controller; use the exclusive headless example below |
| Four-score eval | `docker compose exec backend python eval.py --seconds 15` |

Kinematic twins (plane, copter, rover) + virtual towers + a weaving target run **without waiting on ArduPilot**. Optional SITL:

```bash
docker compose --profile sitl up --build
# then set FORCE_KINEMATIC=0 in .env
```

## Who owns what

| Person | Branch | Main files | Handoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — UI | `codex/ui` | `frontend/` | [UI setup](docs/team/01-ui.md) |
| 2 — backend / integration | `codex/backend` | `main.py`, `brain.py`, `world.py`, `db.py`, shared contracts/config | [Backend setup](docs/team/02-backend.md) |
| 3 — vision / tracking | `codex/vision-tracking` | `tracker.py`, `metrics.py`, `eval.py`, `sim/detector.py`, optional `backend/vision/` | [Vision setup](docs/team/03-vision-tracking.md) |
| 4 — simulator / autonomy | `codex/simulator-autonomy` | adapter/camera files under `backend/sim/`, `mavlink_connection.py`, `agents/`, `allocator.py`, `behaviors/` | [Simulator setup](docs/team/04-simulator-autonomy.md) |

Backend filenames above are relative to `backend/`. Shared-file coordination and exact ownership are in the [team contract](docs/team/CONTRACT.md). Everyone starts from the same foundation; [branch and merge instructions](docs/team/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) explain the flow to `dev`, then `main`.

## Non-negotiables (WHITEOUT scoring)

Live metrics: **coverage, collaboration, efficiency, tracking accuracy**, plus **one-command agent deploy**.

- Inner loop is deterministic BTs at `BRAIN_HZ` (default 10).
- LLM DAG only biases roles (`ai_orchestrator.py` `advise()`).
- No vehicle Kalman; ArduPilot owns own-ship. Tracker is **target-only**.
- Do not scatter `tcp:sitl:5760` — go through `SimAdapter`.

## Saturday / local arctic-sim

`WhiteoutAdapter` talks MAVLink `udpout` to the official four assets. With arctic-sim already up:

```bash
ADAPTER=whiteout docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate backend
```

For a headless controller **instead of** the API backend, stop that backend first and run one separate process using its built image:

```bash
docker compose stop backend
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e ADAPTER=whiteout backend python -m agent --adapter whiteout
```

Do not run the API controller and the headless controller against the same fleet simultaneously.

The baseline hull detector, projection, background camera polling and HUD camera panels are present. Validate their accuracy, timing and repeated-observation handling before claiming reliable tracking. Confirm the current competition's submission interface before implementing an assumed track-upload endpoint. Keep `ADAPTER=local` for kinematic eval. Do not start compose profile `sitl` alongside arctic-sim (host 5760 collides). Checklist: [docs/SATURDAY_WORKSHOP.md](docs/SATURDAY_WORKSHOP.md).
